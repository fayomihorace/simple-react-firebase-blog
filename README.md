## create-react-app

This project uses the popular
[create-react-app (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/) command to setup a
modern React application. This way we can focus on the code itself, and not
worry about configuring many build tools.

The
[package.json](https://github.com/AlterClassIO/react-blog/blob/master/package.json)
file provides four scripts:

- `start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly
  bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
  performance.
- `test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `eject`: Remove create-react-app build dependency from your project.

## Instructions

1. Clone the project repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/AlterClassIO/react-blog`

2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd react-blog`

3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
